\title{Morph raw map data into a road network}
\usage{
morph_road_network(map, mode = c("all", "roads_only", "roads_no_entrances"))
}
\arguments{
\item{map}{\code{rrs_map} data, the GML map data loaded by
the \code{read_rrs_map()}.}

\item{mode}{A character string specifiying the mode of the road network:
\itemize{
\item \code{"all"}: All areas are included in the network (default).
\item \code{"roads_only"}: Only road areas are included.
\item \code{"roads_no_entrances"}: Only road areas are included,
excluding entrances.
}}
}
\value{
A list containing the network components:
\itemize{
\item \code{nodes}: A sf object of nodes with point geometries.
\item \code{edges}: A sf object of edges with linestring geometries.
}
}
\description{
\code{morph_road_network()} converts map data from the RoboCup Rescue Simulation
into a road network.
}
\details{
This road network consists of nodes and edges. Nodes are defined as
the centroids of all areas and the center points the boundaries
between areas. Edges connect nodes between an agent can travel.

gml <- system.file("extdata", "map-test.gml", package = "rrstools")
